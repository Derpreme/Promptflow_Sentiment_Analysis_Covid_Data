# End-to-End Pipeline for Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for **prompt flow-based sentiment analysis** on a standard COVID-19 dataset, showcasing expertise in **AI development**, **machine learning engineering**, and **full-stack data integration**. The pipeline integrates cutting-edge technologies and platforms to deliver robust and scalable solutions for text-based data analysis.

### Key Components

1. **PromptFlow Implementation**: Leveraging the **Microsoft AI Platform** to build a robust and scalable workflow for managing prompts and model interactions.
2. **GPT-4.0 Integration**: Utilizing state-of-the-art **large language models (LLMs)** for precise sentiment analysis and natural language understanding.
3. **Python-MySQL Integration**: Scripts to retrieve and store data in a **MySQL database**, ensuring seamless **data engineering** and **ETL processes**.
4. **Prompt Engineering with Jinja2**: Dynamic prompt generation using **Jinja2 templates** to optimize LLM performance and tailor results.
5. **Data Pipeline**: A **Python-based workflow** to handle data retrieval, processing, and result storage, providing a fully operational **AI/ML pipeline**.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Core source code for data retrieval, LLM integration, and prompt flow orchestration.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for database connections and LLM settings.
- **`templates/`**: Jinja2 templates for prompt engineering and text generation.
- **`results/`**: Processed outputs and analyses stored in structured formats.

## Key Technologies and Tools
